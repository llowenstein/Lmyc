        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
            The Lower Mainland Yacht Cooperative (LMYC) is a provincially registered and regulated non-profit organization, which is owned and operated by its members. LMYC is governed by the British Columbia Co-operative Act.

            The mission and purpose of the Lower Mainland Yacht co-op is to promote Affordable, Safe and Enjoyable recreational sailing.

            As a co-op, it is possible to provide boats, equipment and sailing skill development at a fraction of the cost of any other sailing program you can find. The low cost, however, does require full participation of the members to make it succeed. All members are expected to contribute time for boat maintenance or helping with other activities toward our common goal.
